# Projectile Motion Research Project

Hi, I am Aditi Patel, an MSc Physics student.

This project studies **Projectile Motion** using different computational approaches and compares their accuracy.

---

## 📌 Objective
To analyze projectile motion using:
- Analytical solution (theoretical equations)
- Numerical solution using Euler Method
- Compare both methods using plots and error analysis

---

## 📂 Project Files

- `analytical.py`  
  Contains the exact mathematical solution of projectile motion using physics equations.

- `euler_method.py`  
  Simulates projectile motion using the Euler numerical method.

- `comparison.py`  
  Compares analytical vs Euler results using graphs.

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Kinematics of motion  
- Numerical methods (Euler method)  
- Error analysis  
- Data visualization using Python (Matplotlib)
